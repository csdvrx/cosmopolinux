## But simplified and aimed for console use
#keymaps 0-1,4-5,8-9,12
#alt_is_meta
#include "qwerty-layout"
#include "linux-with-two-alt-keys"
#strings as usual
#compose as usual for "iso-8859-1"

# caps: extra control: seem to still get stuck

# control too at the extra levels to avoid shift+58=Shift_Lock

# esc: kept for muscle memory / habits
#		keycode   1 = Escape

#string Home = "\033[1~"
#string End = "\033[4~"
## 5 extra keys
# Muenkan: End aka Select
#		keycode  92 = Decr_Console
		keycode  92 = Select
# Henkan: Home aka Find
#		keycode  94 = Incr_Console

# Hiragana: to tab between console
		keycode  93 = Last_Console
# Ro: start a new console
# TODO: check Spawn_Console
		keycode  89 = Spawn_Console
# so instead backwards-word-delete aka ^W and forward-word-delete aka ^[d
#		keycode 124 = Control_w Meta_d
# or just Backspace (called Delete in linux-console jargon, while Delete is Remove)
		keycode 124 = Delete Remove

## kbrequest.service triggered when sending KeyboardSignal
# Yen, problem: too easy to reach to map to kbrequest.service
#		keycode 124 = KeyboardSignal
# Fn, same problem
#		keycod  143 = KeyboardSignal
# so instead just scroll backward the console
#		keycode 143 = Scroll_Backward
# better choice: Insert 110 protected by Fn on Thinkpads
		keycode 110 = KeyboardSignal

# directly go to a console with the Fn key
